# DART-Rover
Repository for the autonomous DART rover, ENGR 7B

Uses PixyCam for object detection, an array of three photoresistors for line following, and two sets of RGB LEDs for lighting and/or status indication.

TODO:
- Calibrate line following
- Change modes once target object is recognized
- Recognize when end of course is reached
